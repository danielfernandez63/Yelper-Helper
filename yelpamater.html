            <h3>Step By Step Instructions </h3> <br>
            <div class= "info"> <ol type="1">

            <li> Please make sure you have your Yelp app open. Then click the Yelp symbol towards the top right to start. </li>  <br>

                  <p class= "steps"> </p> <br>

            <li> This step will take one of 12 random food categories and select one of twelve popular options. You will enter this
                 into the Yelp search bar at the top of the app home screen. Enter "(Category given) near me" and hit search.
                  Your categories are: 1 = Mexican, 2 = Thai,  3 = Italian, 4 = Chinese, 5 = Japanese, 6 = BBQ, 7 = Greek, 8 = Steakhouse,
                  9 = Burgers, 10 = Sushi, 11 = Pizza, 12 = Seafood </li> <br>

                <p class= "steps" id="step1"></p>  <br>

            <li> This is where Yelp shines as it uses it proprietary algorithm to sort the restuarants how the see best. We will use that
                 ranking system and use our second random number to select one of the top four restuarants. Because we are using their algorithm
                 this will ensure that the restuarant has a high average review and near to your current location. Feel free to ignore the
                 restuarants that are placed at the top of the listing as an Ad. </li> <br>

                  <p class= "steps" id="step2"></p> <br>

            <li> The Yelper Helper doesn't stop there. The next four variables will be assigned to a reccomended appetizer, drink, meal and dessert.
                 This is not intended to force those choices on you, only give you a reccomendation based on luck and let you focus on enjoying
                 the meal experiance overall and not the stress of deciding. If possible use the online menu provided in the restuarant menu
                 provided under the Yelp resturant page. If the number rolled is ever higher than items listed in that menu sub-category then
                 you must take that number, divide it in half and round up when applicabe for a new number. </li>  <br>

                   <p class= "steps"> </p> <br>

            <li> For the first item, the appetizer, order the corresponding item on the menu. So if it is a 1 then you order the first appetizer listed,
                 if it is a 1 then you order the fourth item on the appetizers. </li> <br>

                  <p class= "steps" id="step3"></p> <br>

            <li> The fourth number is related to your drink. This is a special category in that you are allowed to use the number given and apply it
                 to either the beer menu, cocktail menu or the standard non-alcoholic drink menu. Choose appropiately for the situation. </li> <br>

                  <p class= "steps" id="step4"></p>  <br>

            <li> Apply the fifth number as your meal item. This must start at the beginning of the regular meal related menu items as sub-categories
                 for items are not factored, it's totally based on luck. </li> <br>

                  <p class= "steps" id="step5"></p> <br>

            <li> Then finish off with an item on the dessert menu with the last variable as tummy room allows. </li> <br>

                  <p class= "steps" id="step6"></p> <br>

                 </ol> </div>
